# Build Sight Comprehensive Pricing Strategy

## Executive Summary

Build Sight should use a value-based, tiered subscription strategy that prices against the cost of material-delay downtime (not against generic software categories). The core thesis:

- A single avoided material delay can save a builder more than an entire month of subscription cost.
- SMB builders need clear, predictable pricing with visible upgrade paths.
- Revenue growth should come from a mix of new account conversion, annual plan adoption, and expansion into higher-usage tiers.

Recommended launch pricing:

- **Starter**: **$249/month** or **$2,490/year** (2 months free)
- **Professional**: **$649/month** or **$6,490/year** (2 months free)
- **Business**: **$1,500/month** or **$15,000/year**, plus custom enterprise options

## 2. MARKET RESEARCH & COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

### Direct Competitors

#### Competitor 1: Kojo (construction materials procurement and inventory workflow)
- **Pricing Model**: Subscription, typically quote-based/annual contracts.
- **Price Points**: Commonly positioned as mid-market to enterprise (estimated effective monthly spend often above Build Sight SMB entry pricing).
- **Value Proposition**: Procurement control, purchasing workflows, spend visibility.
- **Strengths**:
  - Deep procurement workflows
  - Strong contractor/distributor process integration
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Heavier implementation burden for smaller builders
  - Less explicit emphasis on early delay-risk prediction for SMB teams
  - Perceived complexity can slow sales cycles in 3-25 employee firms

#### Competitor 2: Buildertrend (all-in-one residential construction management)
- **Pricing Model**: Tiered SaaS subscription.
- **Price Points**: Public tiered plans typically in the mid-to-high hundreds per month (varies by package, commitment, and add-ons).
- **Estimated User Base / Market Share**: Large SMB contractor footprint in North America; broad adoption among residential builders/remodelers.
- **Customer Feedback (common themes)**:
  - **Praise**: broad feature set, centralization of workflows
  - **Complaints**: complexity, add-on costs, and paying for features outside core need
- **Pricing Gap Build Sight Can Exploit**:
  - Build Sight can win with a narrower, high-ROI promise: **"prevent delay downtime before supplier admission."**

### Adjacent Benchmark Competitor

#### Procore (enterprise benchmark, indirect for many SMBs)
- **Pricing Model**: Custom annual contract.
- **Positioning**: Enterprise platform with broad PM/financial coverage.
- **Implication for Build Sight**:
  - Strong anchor for reference pricing ("enterprise capability at SMB-ready cost for the delay-risk workflow")
  - SMB firms often consider Procore too expensive/complex for a focused delay-intelligence use case.

### Market Positioning Options

- **Premium Position** (20-30% above market average)
  - Use if Build Sight proves materially better prediction lead times and outcomes in first 3 months.
  - Candidate pricing: Starter $299, Professional $749, Business $1,800.

- **Competitive Position** (match market leaders on core tiers)
  - Candidate pricing: Starter $249, Professional $649, Business $1,500.

- **Value Position** (20-30% below alternatives while preserving margin)
  - Candidate pricing: Starter $199, Professional $499, Business $1,200.

**Recommended launch stance**: **Competitive-Value Hybrid**  
Launch at Starter $249 / Professional $649 / Business $1,500 with disciplined testing, then move up or down by segment based on elasticity and win/loss data.

## 3. PRICING TIER STRUCTURE

### Pricing Architecture Principles

1. Tie packaging to operational scale (projects, suppliers, line items) rather than arbitrary user-seat constraints.
2. Keep upgrade triggers natural: volume growth, multi-site complexity, and faster alert cadence.
3. Preserve a clear "best value" middle tier to support both conversion and revenue.

### Tier Design

#### TIER 1: STARTER
- **Target Customer**: Solo contractors, owner-operators, and very small builders running a handful of projects.
- **Price Point**: **$249/month** or **$2,490/year**.

- **Extra Supplier Bundle (5 suppliers)**: $99/month
- **High-volume data processing overage**: usage-based (quoted by volume)
- **Custom AI Integration & Advisory**: $20K-$50K/project

### Packaging Guardrails

- Do not gate core risk scoring behind top tiers (must preserve core product promise).
- Gate by scale and workflow sophistication (volume, cadence, governance).
- Ensure each upgrade yields a measurable ROI step-up, not just feature access.

## 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING STRATEGIES

### Price Anchoring

- **Primary Anchor**: Cost of inaction (idle crew + schedule slip + client dissatisfaction).
  - Example messaging: "One 3-day material delay can cost $6K-$15K. Professional costs $649/month."
- **Decoy Effect**:
  - Position Professional as the "best value" with a strong feature/capacity jump from Starter.
- **Reference Pricing**:
  - Compare against enterprise alternatives and manual coordination labor costs.
- **Bundle Value Display**:
  - Show included value stack (alerts, risk engine, recommendations, reporting) and "if bought separately" equivalent.

### Cognitive Biases (Applied Ethically)

- **Charm Pricing**:
  - Use 249 and 649 in SMB tiers for conversion psychology.
- **Prestige Pricing**:
  - Use round-number enterprise price (1,500/month) to reinforce business-critical positioning.
- **Loss Aversion**:
  - Emphasize downside of not acting early ("what you risk losing in labor margin and schedule confidence").
- **Endowment Effect**:
  - During trial, pre-populate dashboard with sample risk patterns and projected savings to increase perceived ownership/value.
- **Social Proof**:
  - Include customer evidence ("X days of delay avoided", "Y labor hours saved") near pricing CTA.

## 5. PRICING EXPERIMENTS & OPTIMIZATION

### A/B Testing Plan

#### Test 1: Price Points
- **Hypothesis**: Professional at $699 may increase ARPU with manageable conversion impact.
- **Variants**:
  - Control: $649
  - Variant A: $699
  - Variant B: $599
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - Plan conversion rate
  - 60-day retention
  - Net new MRR per visitor

#### Test 2: Packaging
- **Hypothesis**: Increasing included supplier connectors in Professional from 10 to 12 improves win rate in multi-supplier firms.
- **Variants**:
  - Control: 10 connectors
  - Variant: 12 connectors, same price
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - Conversion by firm size
  - Time-to-value (first actionable alert)
  - 90-day expansion rate

#### Test 3: Trial Length
- **Hypothesis**: 14-day trial + guided onboarding call outperforms 30-day unassisted trial on paid conversion.
- **Variants**:
  - 14-day with onboarding milestone prompts
  - 30-day self-serve
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - Activation rate (connect supplier + receive first risk signal)
  - Trial-to-paid conversion
  - CAC payback time

#### Test 4: Annual Discount
- **Hypothesis**: 2 months free (annual) yields better annual adoption than 15% flat annual discount.
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - Annual plan selection rate
  - Blended churn
